I plan to use GitHub as a portfolio to showcase my coding projects and development progress over time. Itâ€™s a great way for potential employers to see real examples of my work, including how I write and structure code. GitHub Pages can also help me build a simple personal website to highlight my best projects, resume, and contact information. Using version control with Git also shows that I have professional workflow skills. Overall, having an active GitHub presence helps me stand out and demonstrate my experience more clearly than a resume alone.
