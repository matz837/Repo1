I chose not to use jGRASP because it was the IDE used in my first Java class, and I didnâ€™t enjoy the overall experience. 
While it was functional, I found it limited in features and not as user-friendly. Compared to my prior experience with VSCode, 
jGRASP felt outdated, and I preferred sticking with the IDE I was already comfortable with.
